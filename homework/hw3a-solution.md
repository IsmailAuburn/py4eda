# HW3A Solution — Git and Version Control

## Part 1: Repository Cloning
- I cloned the instructor repository into `class_repo`.
- I checked the remote and recent commits.

## Part 2: Portfolio Repository Creation
- I created `my_repo` with `homework/`, `projects/`, and `notes/`.
- I added `README.md` and `.gitignore`.
- I committed the changes.

## Part 3: GitHub Publishing
- I created a public GitHub repository named `py4eda-work`.
- I set the remote `origin` to: https://github.com/IsmailAuburn/py4eda-work
- I pushed the local `main` branch to GitHub.
## Questions

### Reflections
1. **How is using Git better than just saving “final_v2_reallyfinal.docx”?**  
   Git keeps a clean history of each change with a message, so I can go back to any version. It also separates “files I am editing” from “files I committed,” which is safer than manually copying files.

2. **Why do we have two repos (the instructor repo and my own repo)?**  
   The instructor repo is read-only so I can always pull class materials without breaking them. My own repo is where I keep my work and push it to GitHub to submit.

3. **Why are good commit messages useful?**  
   A message like “Add Part 3 GitHub publishing” tells me exactly what changed. Generic messages like “update” are not helpful when I look back later.
